# Introduction

This small PostgreSQL project explores a job posting database to identify:

- Top-paying jobs & skills based on average annual salaries.

- High-demand skills by analyzing their occurrence in job postings.

The project utilizes SQL queries to aggregate and analyze data from job postings, linking salaries, skills, and demand.

ðŸ”Ž You can check the SQL queries in [HERE](/project_sql/).

# Tools I used

- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- VsCode
- Git & GitHub

# The Analysis

Each query in this project was aimed at investigating specific aspects of the current job market:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

```sql
SELECT
    jpf.job_id,
    cd.name AS company_name,
    jpf.job_title,
    jpf.job_location,
    jpf.job_schedule_type,
    jpf.salary_year_avg,
    jpf.job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact jpf
    JOIN company_dim cd ON cd.company_id = jpf.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

This query reveals the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst jobs, highlighting key trends:

- Salary Range: Top salaries vary between $375,000 and $650,000, with Mantys offering the highest pay.

- Job Titles: High salaries are often tied to senior or specialized roles (e.g., Director of Safety Data Analysis).

### 2. Requested skills for top paying jobs

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        jpf.job_id,
        cd.name AS company_name,
        jpf.job_title,
        jpf.job_location,
        jpf.salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact jpf
        JOIN company_dim cd ON cd.company_id = jpf.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
)

SELECT
    tpj.*,
    sd.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs tpj
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sjd ON tpj.job_id = sjd.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
This query reveals the most demanded skills for the top paying jobs presented before, as seen on the following graph:

### 3. Top Demanded Skills

The following query brings the most demanded skills for a Data Analyst worldwide.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS skill_demand
FROM job_postings_fact jpf
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON jpf.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    skill_demand DESC
LIMIT 5
```

| Skills   | Demand Count |
|----------|--------------|
| SQL      | 7291         |
| Excel    | 4611         |
| Python   | 4330         |
| Tableau  | 3745         |
| Power BI | 2609         |

- **SQL**, **Excel** and **Python** are still fundamental for a Data Analyst, being the top 3 most requested skills in job postings for this role.

- Visualization tools like **Power BI** and **Tableau** are also highly requested, being top 4 and 5 respectively.

### 4. Top Paying Skills

This query gets the top skills based on their average salary for Data Analysts.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    TRUNC(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact jpf
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON jpf.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    jpf.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC
LIMIT 10
```

With this query we area able to find a more diverse result, with Cloud (Terraform, VMware) & A.I. (Couchbase, Datarobot) skills being more present.

### 5. Most optimal skills to learn

The objective with this query is to find what are the skills that have both a high demand and salary inside the Data Analyst job market.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 50
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

Once again, skills like **SQL** and **Python** are present, appearing in various high-paying job postings.

However, the skill with the best average salary is **Airflow**, with 71 postings and an average pay of $116387

# What I learned

Throughout this project, I not only strengthened my existing knowledge but also gained valuable new insights, particularly in advanced aggregation functions and joins.

I was especially pleased to discover that even the most complex problems and queries can be broken down into simpler, more efficient solutions and how I can achieve that.

# Conclusions

This project strengthened my SQL expertise and offered valuable perspectives on the data analyst job market. The insights gained from the analysis help in prioritizing skill development and job-hunting strategies. I can say that this exploration underscores the necessity of ongoing learning and staying adaptable to evolving trends.
